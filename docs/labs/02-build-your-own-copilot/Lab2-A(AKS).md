# Lab 3.1: Containerizing Miyagi UI and Recommendation service to Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS) 

### Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

In this lab, you will containerize and deploy the Miyagi UI and recommendation services to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). You will start by configuring Kubernetes and building Docker images for both services. The process involves pushing these images to Azure Container Registry (ACR) and then deploying them on an AKS cluster. This ensures that the services are seamlessly integrated and operational within a scalable, containerized environment applying Kubernetes configurations, updating service IP addresses, and verifying the deployment by accessing the services through their respective endpoints.

## Lab objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Deploy AKS Services
- Task 2: Build a Docker Image for the Miyagi UI
- Task 3: Build Docker Images for the Recommendation service
- Task 4: Push the Docker Image of Recommendation service to the Container registry
- Task 5: Deploy AKS Pods

### Lab 3.2: Explore and Verify the Containerized Miyagi UI and Recommendation service in AKS

- Task 1: Explore Recommendation service in AKS using Ingress Endpoint
- Task 2: Explore the Miyagi App in AKS using Ingress Endpoint

### Task 1: Deploy AKS Services

In this task, you will deploy the Miyagi recommendation and UI services to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. This involves logging into the Azure portal, applying Kubernetes configurations, and updating configuration files with the services' external IP addresses.

1. Navigate back to the Visual Studio code window and navigate to **miyagi (1)/deploy (2)/infrastructure (3)/kubernetes/manifests (4)/50-miyagi (5)**, right-click on **50-miyagi** in the cascading menu, and select **Open in integrated Terminal (6)**.

1. Run the following command to log in to the Azure portal.

   ```
   az login
   ```

1. This will redirect to **Microsoft login page**, select your Azure account **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>**, and navigate back to the **Visual studio code**.

   ![](./Media/azure-account-select.png)

1. Run the following command to log in to the Azure portal.

   ```
   az aks get-credentials -n <inject key="aksname" enableCopy="true"/> -g <inject key="rgname" enableCopy="true"/>
   ```

   >**Important**: The command az aks get-credentials -n <inject key="aksname" enableCopy="true"/> -g <inject key="rgname" enableCopy="true"/> is used in Azure's command-line interface (CLI) to retrieve and merge the Kubernetes configuration files for a specified Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster into the local kubeconfig file.
   
1. Once the command finishes you should now have access to the cluster and can run the following commands to deploy the application services.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f ./miyagi-recommendation-service.yaml
   ```
   ```
   kubectl apply -f ./miyagi-ui-service.yaml
   ```
   
    >**Note**: Upon successful execution of the above commands. The Kubernetes will read the YAML file and apply its configurations to the cluster. It will create miyagi-recommendation- 
    service and miyagi-ui
 
1. Once the services have been deployed run the below command and keep track of the service's **external IPs**. It could take a few minutes for the **external IPs** to appear so wait a few minutes before running the command.

   ```
   kubectl get svc
   ```
