### Task 2: Understanding the implementation of the Recommendation service

In this task, recommendation service implements RAG pattern using Semantic Kernel SDK. The details of the implementation are captured in the Jupyter Notebook in the folder miyagi/sandbox/usecases/rag/dotnet. You can open the notebook in VSCode and run the cells to understand step-by-step details of how the Recommendation Service is implemented. Pay special attention to how the RAG pattern is implemented using Semantic Kernel. Select kernel as .NET Interactive in the top right corner of the notebook.

1. In the Visual Studio Code, navigate to **miyagi folder (1)** and expand **sandbox (2)/usecases (3)/rag (4)/dotnet (5)** folder and select **Getting-started.ipynb (6)**.

   ![](./Media/miyagi-image19.png)

1. **Execute the notebook cell by cell** (using either Ctrl + Enter to stay on the same cell or Shift + Enter to advance to the next cell) and observe the results of each cell execution.
  

   > **Note**: Make sure **.Net Interactive** is in ready State, if not please wait for 2 to 3 minutes. If it is still not loading, kindly close and reopen Visual Studio. Also, please do not click on **Run All** option to execute all the cells at a time which may lead to exceed in token limit that results Error: 503 â€“ Service unreachable.

### Task 3: Run recommendation service locally
In this task, you will run the recommendation service locally by using Visual Studio Code to build and run the service in the terminal and then verify its functionality by accessing the Swagger page in the browser.

1. To open a new terminal, naviagate to **miyagi (1)/services (2)/recommendation-service (3)/dotnet (4)** and right-click on **dotnet** in cascading menu select **Open in intergate Terminal (5)**.

    ![](./Media/task4-1.png)

1. Run the following command to run the recommendation service locally
    
   ```
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

   > **Note**: Let the command run, meanwhile you can proceed with the next step.
   > **Note**: The commands dotnet build and dotnet run are fundamental in .NET Core and .NET 5+ environments for building and running .NET applications locally on your machine.

1. Open another tab in Edge browser, in the browser window paste the following link

   ```
   http://localhost:5224/swagger/index.html 
   ```

   > **Note**: Refresh the page continuously until you get the swagger page for the recommendation service as depicted in the image below.

   ![](./Media/miyagi-image21.png)

### Task 4: Run miyagi frontend locally

In this task, you will run the miyagi frontend locally by installing dependencies using npm and yarn and then starting the development server. You will verify its functionality by accessing the local development server in the browser.

1. To open a new terminal, navigate to  **miyagi folder (1)**, then expand **ui (2)** and right-click on **ui/typescript (3)** folder , in cascading menu select **Open in integrated Terminal (4)**.

   ![](./Media/image-rg-25.png)

1. Run the following command to install the dependencies
   
    ```
    npm install --global yarn
    yarn install
    yarn dev
    ```

   > **Note**: Please wait till the command gets executed successfully. It will take up to 5 minutes. Once the **yarn dev** command starts executing wait for 2 minutes and proceed with the next step.
   
   > **Note**: These commands (npm install --global yarn, yarn install, and yarn dev) are indeed essential in JavaScript and TypeScript projects for managing dependencies and running scripts necessary to set up and run applications. They ensure that all required packages are installed (yarn install), and they execute development scripts (yarn dev) defined in the project's configuration (package.json).

1. Open a new tab in Edge browser, and browse the following URL:

   ```
   http://localhost:4001
   ```

   >**Note:** You can get the port from the logs in the terminal.

      ![](./Media/error-pop-up.png)

   >**Note:** If you encounter an **Unhandled Runtime Error** pop-up, close the pop-up and also dismiss the error message at the bottom left corner.

     ![](./Media/error-side.png)

   > **[!IMPORTANT]**<br>
   > Please do not close the VS Code as you will need the localhost running for the future tasks.

### Task 5: Persist embeddings in Azure AI Search

In this task, you will persist embeddings in Azure AI Search by executing a POST request in Swagger UI, verifying the execution, and then confirming the creation of the index in the Azure portal.

1. Navigate back to the **swagger UI** page, scroll to **Memory** session, click on **POST /dataset (1)** for expansion, and click on **Try it out (2)**.
