# Lab: Build Custom Copilot Application using Azure AI Foundry

### Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

## Lab objectives 

In this lab, you'll run Chat Copilot locally after retrieving Azure OpenAI Service values from the Azure portal. By cloning the Chat-Copilot GitHub repo and setting up dependencies, you'll configure and execute the application. Uploading documents enables interaction with Copilot, which generates responses based on their content, complete with citations for validation. This exercise provides hands-on experience in utilizing Chat Copilot with your own data, managing documents and sessions within the application.

# Exercise 1: Run the Chat Copilot App Locally

- Task 1: Retrieving the Azure OpenAI Service values
- Task 2: Cloning the Chat-Copilot GitHub Repo
- Task 3: Setting up the Environment
- Task 4: Configure and run the Chat Copilot App Locally

# Exercise 2: Chat with your own documents

- Task 1: Chat with your own documents in the Chat Copilot Application
- Task 2: Cloning the Chat-Copilot GitHub Repo
 
# Exercise 1: Run the Chat Copilot App Locally

In this lab, you will run the Chat Copilot app locally by setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and launching the application for testing and interaction.

### Task 1: Retrieving the Azure OpenAI Service values

   cd C:\Users\azureuser\chat-copilot\scripts\
   ```

1. Run the below command to install Chocolatey, dotnet-7.0-sdk, nodejs, and yarn:

   ```
   .\Install.ps1
   ```

    ![](./Media/cp8.png)   

   >**Note:** If you receive an error that the script is not digitally signed or cannot execute on the system, you may need to change the execution policy or unblock the script.

### Task 4: Configure and run the Chat Copilot App locally

In this task, you will configure and run the Chat Copilot app locally by setting up the environment, adjusting configuration files, and launching the application for testing and development.

1. Configure Chat Copilot by running the following command. You can use the Azure OpenAI Service Name, Key, Endpoint, and the already deployed model names that you noted down in the previous steps or use the values from the below mentioned table.
   
   ```
   .\Configure.ps1 -AIService {AI_SERVICE} -APIKey {API_KEY} -Endpoint {AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT} -CompletionModel {DEPLOYMENT_NAME} -EmbeddingModel {DEPLOYMENT_NAME}
   ```
   | **Variables**                          | **Values**                                            |
   | ---------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------|
   | API_KEY                                | **<inject key="OpenAIKey" enableCopy="true"/>**       |
   | AI_SERVICE                             | **AzureOpenAI**| 
   | AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT                  | **<inject key="OpenAIEndpoint" enableCopy="true"/>**  |
   | CompletionModel:{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}      | **<inject key="CompletionModel" enableCopy="true"/>** |
   | EmbeddingModel:{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}       | **<inject key="EmbeddingModel" enableCopy="true"/>**  |

   >**Note:** If a Security warning pop-up window appears, choose **Yes**
   >
   >**Note:** The code should look similar to the image below:

     ![](./Media/cp9.png)

1. Run Chat Copilot locally. This step starts the **backend API** application. frontend
 
   ```powershell
   .\Start-Backend.ps1
   ```
   > **Note:** It may take a around 5 minutes for Yarn packages to install on the first run, wait untill the command run successfully.
 
1. Open another tab in **Edge**, in the browser window paste the following link, and you should see a confirmation message: `Healthy`.
 
   ```powershell
   http://localhost:40443/healthz
   ```
   > **Note:** Don't close the PowerShell window keep it running up.
  
     ![](./Media/data9.png)
    
1. In the LabVM, click on **Start**, from the start menu search for **PowerShell 7 (1)** and select for **PowerShell 7 (2)**.

   ![](./Media/cp10.png)
 
1. Run the following command to change the path.
 
   ```
   cd C:\Users\azureuser\chat-copilot\scripts\
   ```
 
1. Run the following to set the execution policy.
 
   ```
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
   ```
 
1. The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic. If promted **Do you want to change the execution policy?,** enter **A** and hit **Enter**.
 
1. Configure **Chat Copilot** by running the following command.
 
   ```powershell
   .\Start-Frontend.ps1
   ```

    ![](./Media/cp11.png)   

     >**Note:** Please wait for 5-7 mins for the command to run completely. If it throws any warnings please ignore.     

1. Once the deployment of the script is executed successfully it will redirect to `http://localhost:3000/` Chat CoPilot in **Edge** browser.
 
   >**Note:** Please wait for 3-4 mins for the browser to load
  
1. You will get an output similar to this for the frontend:

   ![azure](./Media/data11.png)

1. You will get an output similar to this for the backend:

   ![azure](./Media/data12.png)
