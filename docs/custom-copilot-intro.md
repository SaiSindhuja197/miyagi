# Build Custom Copilot Application using Azure AI Foundry

### Overall Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you will explore how to use Chat Copilot with your own data, leveraging Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI Service. You will begin by retrieving necessary service values from the Azure portal and setting up the Chat Copilot app locally. Through configuring the app and uploading documents, you’ll enable the generation of context-based responses with citations for validation. This lab offers hands-on experience in integrating your data with Chat Copilot, managing documents, and interacting with the application for personalized insights.

## Objective

Understand how to configure and run the Chat Copilot application locally, integrate your own data with Azure AI Search, and generate responses with contextual accuracy. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Bringing your own data with Azure AI Search**: This hands-on exercise aims to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with languages like C#, Python, and Java by allowing the creation of easily chainable plugins. 
  
## Pre-requisites

Participants should have the following prerequisites

- **Basic Knowledge of Azure Services**: Familiarity with Azure OpenAI Service and Azure AI Search.
- **Experience with Git and Repositories**: Ability to clone and work with GitHub repositories.
- **Basic Programming Skills**: Proficiency in setting up environments and running applications locally.

## Architecture

The architecture integrates **Azure OpenAI Service**, **Azure AI Search**, and the **Chat Copilot application** to provide personalized responses based on user-uploaded documents. Documents are uploaded to the Chat Copilot app, indexed by Azure AI Search, and used to generate context-aware responses through Azure OpenAI's language models. The application is run locally, pulling configuration values from the Azure portal and leveraging pre-built components from a GitHub repository. This setup enables seamless interaction with your data, providing accurate responses enriched with citations for validation.
